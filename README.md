# C++ Modules

Welcome to the C++ Modules repository! This collection of projects is part of my learning journey in mastering C++ programming. Each module focuses on different aspects of C++ to build a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Module 00 - Basics of C++
This module introduces the fundamental concepts of C++ programming, such as:
- Basic syntax
- Data types
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions
- Input and output operations

---

## Module 01 - Memory Allocation
In this module, I learnt about memory management in C++:
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
- Understanding stack vs. heap memory

---

## Module 02 - Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operators Overload
This module covers operator overloading and polymorphism:
- Function overloading
- Operator overloading

**Complex Numbers**: Implementing arithmetic operations for complex numbers using operator overloading.

---

## Module 03 - Inheritance
Learnt about inheritance in C++:
- Single and multiple inheritance
- Constructors and destructors in inheritance
- Virtual inheritance

**ClapTrap**: Building a robot class with inherited features.  
**DiamondTrap**: Combining multiple inheritance and resolving ambiguities.

---

## Module 04 - Abstract Classes
This module dives into the concept of abstract classes and interfaces in C++:

- Abstract Classes: Understanding the definition and purpose of abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated and may contain pure virtual functions.
- Interfaces: Exploring how abstract classes can be used as interfaces to define a contract for derived classes.
- Polymorphism: Utilizing polymorphism to allow for flexible and interchangeable class designs.

---

## Module 05 - Repetition and Exceptions
I've learnt how to manage errors effectively using exceptions:

- Exception handling: how to use try, catch, and throw to handle errors gracefully in programs.
- Custom exceptions: created custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios in a more descriptive way, extending the std::exception class.

---

## Module 06 - Type Casting
This module covers the different types of casts in C++ and when to use each of them:

- Static Cast: Converting between related types, like pointers or references of base and derived classes.
- Dynamic Cast: Safe casting between pointers or references in polymorphic class hierarchies.
- Const Cast: Adding or removing the const qualifier from a variable.
- Reinterpret Cast: Low-level cast that converts between any pointer types.

---

## Module 07 - Templates
This module introduces the concept of templates in C++ and how they enable generic programming:

- Function Templates: Writing functions that can work with any data type, making code reusable and flexible.
- Class Templates: Defining classes that can operate with any data type.
- Specialization: Providing specific behavior for certain data types in templates.
- This module emphasized how templates are a powerful feature of C++ that allows for type-independent programming and code reusability.
