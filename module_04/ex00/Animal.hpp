/**
 * 
 * A virtual function (also known as virtual methods) 
 * is a member function that is declared within a base class and 
 * is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class. When you refer 
 * to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, 
 * you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the method.
 * 
 * Making base class destructor virtual guarantees 
 * that the object of derived class is destructed properly,
 * i.e., both base class and derived class destructors are called.
